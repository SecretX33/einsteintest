# einsteintest

Based on web version made by [RachaCuca](https://rachacuca.com.br/teste-de-einstein/), but improved. In my version you can swap houses and save your progress while playing on your mobile device. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it, the game that resulted from the effort is very cool.

## Features
Which my inspiration doesn't have any of these.

* Swap houses with each other
* On the fly save (auto save every time user close the app)
* Multi language support
* **You may now play on your mobile!**


## Download
Since I know we tend to be kinda lazy ~~myself included~~, you can get a compiled APK of this app right off my personal Google Drive by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1H-POzyCZ0Y_5rkSdGmxhuyFssb8eRB_1).
